    <h3>Educate</h3>
    <p>Racial injustice is defined as unfair treatment and discrimination based on race or ethnicity. It can manifest itself in a variety of ways, including discrimination in employment, housing, education, and the criminal justice system. Addressing racial injustice necessitates understanding it and the ways it has been perpetuated.
    </p>

    <img src="images/Picture2.png" />
    <h3>Inform You</h3>
    <p>The COVID-19 epidemic has disproportionately afflicted people of color, notably African Americans and Latinx people. Individuals of color are more likely than white people to be arrested, convicted, and sentenced to prison for the same offences. They also experience housing and employment discrimination, which can limit their access to excellent homes and career prospects.
    </p>

    <h3>Racism</h3>
    <p>Racism has a long history in the United States, and its influence can be found in many aspects of education, business, media, and daily life. Following the death of George Floyd in Minnesota, as well as many other high-profile police shootings, Black Lives Matter rallies erupted throughout the country and have since persisted as activists demand significant change. 
    </p>
      
    <img src="images/Picture4.png" />
    <h3>Where else else can this problem have lasting effects?</h3>
    <p>Many social workers are all too aware of the devastating and long-term effects of racial injustice on individuals' mental and physical health, and the NASW has recently expressed its support for federal legislation enacting police reform and addressing systemic racism within the criminal justice system.
